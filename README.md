# 🧠 Nimbo AI  
Nimbo AI is a conversational AI app built using **SwiftUI**. It provides an intuitive and visually appealing chat interface, enabling users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot in real time.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Interactive Chat Interface**:  
   - Sleek, user-friendly design.  
   - Differentiated user and AI messages for clarity.  
- **AI-Powered Responses**:  
   - Send user queries to an API for intelligent responses.  
   - Inline loading indicator while waiting for AI replies.  
- **Customizable & Responsive UI**:  
   - Dynamic handling of the keyboard height.  
   - Easy-to-read, color-coded message bubbles.  
- **Chat Controls**:  
   - Clear chat with a single button.  
   - Smooth scroll-to-bottom functionality for new messages.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **SwiftUI**: Modern, declarative UI framework for iOS apps.  
- **API Integration**: Fetch responses from an AI model through a custom `APIService`.  

## 🔧 How to Run the Project  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Nimbo-AI.git  
   ```  
2. Open the project in **Xcode**.  
3. Make sure your development environment is set up with:  
   - Xcode 15 or later.  
   - iOS 16+ deployment target.  
4. Replace the placeholder in `APIService.swift` with your API endpoint or key.  
5. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.  

## 🛠️ API Integration  
Ensure you have a backend service or AI API for processing user queries. Update the `APIService` class with your API details:  
```swift  
// Example method inside APIService
func getAIResponse(userMessage: String, completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void) {
    // Replace with your API logic
}
```  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **`MainChatView.swift`**: The core view for chat interaction.  
- **`APIService.swift`**: Handles communication with the AI backend.  
- **Assets**: Includes app logo and UI assets.  

## 🌟 How It Works  
1. Users type their messages in the input field and tap the **Send** button.  
2. The app sends the user's message to an AI API through the `APIService`.  
3. While waiting for a response, a loading indicator (`...`) is displayed inline in the chat.  
4. Once the AI response is received, it's displayed in the chat interface.  
5. Users can clear the chat history using the **Trash** button.  

## 💡 Future Enhancements  
- Add **voice input** for hands-free interaction.  
- Implement **persistent chat history**.  
- Enhance the UI with **animations** and **theme customization**.  
- Integrate **image generation** or **media-rich responses**.  
- Expand **multi-language support**.
